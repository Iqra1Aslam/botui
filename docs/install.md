# Installation

It's available on [NPM registery](https://npmjs.org/botui) and you can install it using your favorite package manager. Here is an example with `npm`:

Install `botui` core library and its React package.

```bash
npm i botui@next @botui/react
```

> Notice we're using botui@next to install the `next` channel. The `latest` channel still points to the old version for backward compatibility.

You can think of the core library as the `bot` and the framework packages as the `UI` parts of BotUI, respectively.
